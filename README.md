# Accounts - a periodic budgeting tool for recording snapshots of your budget

I created this initially in the format of how I manually record my budget.
Every week I record my current budget standing and calculate how much debt I
still have, how much more I have to pay off, and how much my net worth is.
The crazy thing is that after awhile I started to want more stats and charts
on what was actually happening with my money, including how certain life events
affected my spending. Most of the data is coarse and raw, but with time I'm
hoping to make this a tool in which single users can track and parse all the
input data and make better and more informed financial decisions. Enjoy!!

A couple of concepts that I'm trying to achieve in order.

1) Create a web app that is optimized for data input and some cool outputs
2) API creation for mobile app.
3) Conquer Barad-d√ªr.

P.S. - Nick, get out of here!
